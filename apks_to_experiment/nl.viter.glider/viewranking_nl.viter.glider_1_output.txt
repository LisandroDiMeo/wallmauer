We’ve been grappling with making it local but two considerations
1.
Haven’t figured out what should trigger updates. Every commit sounds crazy, every save would be perfect but too intensive also.
2.
LLMs will not be self hosted. We haven’t been able to get the same results with any smaller LLMs
To answer your questions we definitely want to make this available for local repos and ideally self hosted, on a technical level that’s probably several month away.
